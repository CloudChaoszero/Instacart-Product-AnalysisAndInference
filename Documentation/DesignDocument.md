# Instacart Product Analysis: Design Document

## Introduction

This is the overall project documentation on the following:

1. Design

2. Plan

3. Implementation

### Overview

Instacart released a sample of Product and Order related data for model prediction/forecasting via Kaggle in 2017. We dive into the data to determine any key Inscart related habits and additional information through Exploratory Data Analysis. Thereafter, we proceed into going through additional advanced statistical models of predicting order related habits or anything derived from our analyses.

Update (3/14): I took out the inference portion and settles for forecasting in the 2nd phase of the analysis.

### Context

Project serves as an opportunity to showcase Data ETL related actions to deliver standard & normalized data for digestion into analyses. These analyses can range from the following:

1. Essential Exploratory Data Analysis

2. Forecasting

From these analyses, we determine any particular associations of data from users and make recommendations.

Lastly, this project serves as an opportunity to showecase the types of analyses I have delivered from my past experiences, and how I can translate that information to other organizations.

### Goals and Non-Goals

* Goals
    
    * Provide concise and clear detail and implementation of Data Engineering (ETL process) for users adopting project
    
    * Provide In-depth and qualitative exploratory analysis before proceeding into forecasting or any other advanced statistical analysis

* Non-Goals
    
    * Do not provide full fledged pipeline due to lack of updates in data (static data--not real time ingestion)
    
    * Not proceeding with excessive amount of machine learning models, but focusing only on key models for answering questions
    
### Milestones

1. Data ETL (February)

2. Analysis (End of February)

3. Forecasting (End of February)


### Existing Solution

Project was published in 2017-2018, so there may be other existing solutions that were recommended and implemented from Instacart team.

### Proposed Solution

TBA...

### Impact

* Opportunity to showcase full-fledged analytics and technical practices

* Drive analyses to provide potential recommendations for provided Instacart data (though that may have changed since this is aged data)

### Open Questions/FAQ

* What models to consider for predicting next ordered item for some given customer

* For forecasting what signals indicate re-ordering of a product,

    * Would I need more signals?
    
    * Would deeper feature engineering be sufficient?
    

### Details and Timeline Scoping

Expected delivery of project in Mid-February 2019

## 3. Implementation

* Python

* Jupyter Notebook
