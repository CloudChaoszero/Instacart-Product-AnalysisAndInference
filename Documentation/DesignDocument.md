### Overview

Instacart released a sample of Product and Order related data for model prediction/forecasting via Kaggle in 2017. We dive into the data to determine any key Inscart related habits and additional information through Exploratory Data Analysis. Thereafter, we proceed into going through Inference and additional advanced statistical models of predicting order related habits or anything derived from our analyses.

### Context

Project serves as an opportunity to showcase Data ETL related actions to deliver standard & normalized data for digestion into analyses. These analyses can range from the following:

1. Essential Exploratory Data Analysis

2. A/B Testing

3. Forecasting

From these analyses, we determine any particular associations of data from users and make recommendations.

Lastly, this project serves as an opportunity to showecase the types of analyses I have delivered from my past experiences, and how I can translate that information to other organizations.
